Code Academy "Responsive Club Website" Activity Submission.

## General Description
Hello! This is the simple club website design I have created and came up with for my code academy project submission.
It consists of five sections: Header, 3 informational areas/divisions, and a footer.
It uses flexbox design as well as a simple media query to make this as user friendly as my skill allows.
Unfortunately at the moment, I'm not that creative, however I suppose that comes with time! :)
