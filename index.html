        <p>Hello! My name is Kelton Truman, and I would consider myself a relatively big fan of Rocket League! It's one of the only quality games of it's kind in this day and age, and I always end up coming back to it!<br><br>I love all aspects of rocket league except for 1v1s, also known as duels. Anything else, whether it be standard (3v3), doubles (2v2), or any of the extra gamemodes, like rumble or hoops, I think it's all a relatively good time!<br><br>In terms of rank, I would consider myself overall to be Champion 3, but I have hit Grand Champ in hoops in season 5, and for the first time hit GC in 3v3 standard in season 6! I don't mind who I play with though, I'm just having a good time regardless. Also, I mainly use the Dominus, but switch to the Skyline every now and then.<br><br>I'm making this club as a project to help me in refining my skills towards the software engineering career path.</p>

    <h2>About Us</h2>

    <div class="container">
        <p>The Rocket League Club of Augusta, as stated before, is a club meant to pull together those of us who share the common interest of playing rocket league. We have fun teaching each other as well as learning from each other to both become better at the game and have fun doing it!</p>
        <p>This club has no restriction on player rank, and we accept anyone in the club, as long as they are within the Augusta, Georgia area and play rocket league!</p>
        <p>We could preferably do without the toxicity. Although you can rage all you want, because personally I think its hilarious! Rocket League is a hard game, and has a steep learning curve. Everyone starts somewhere!</p>

    <h2>Our Goals</h2>
    <div class="container">
        <p>Mainly, we want to provide a great place for people locally to learn more about how to play the game from those who have more skill, as well as provide an opportunity for those more skilled to teach people how to get better! It's really as simple as that.</p>
        <p>An additional goal of ours is to have weekend play sessions with whoever is down to play over the weekend. We will turn our focus (for pc players only) to more custom content, more specifically custom maps, to just have fun and goof off with each other! For those who are unable to download custom content (console players), we will have something similiar with private matches with completely randomized settings!</p>
        <p>Finally, I hope we can eventually host get-togethers at the lovely local food places to just get to know each other and form possible friendships in real life!</p>
